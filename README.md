# MQB DatasetParser
This tool is supposed to parse A5 Front Assist dataset (or any other in the future) for ODIS-E (xml) and eventually understand it. As of now it is possible to load XML file and compare it with other XML file to see which parts are modified. 

It is still quite crude and mainly for powerusers but this is how it can be used to find differences

there are 64 "bytes" in comparsion window on each line so to find real location you can use line x 64 to find exact position in dataset
