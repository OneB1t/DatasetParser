# MQB DatasetParser
This tool is supposed to parse A5 Front Assist dataset (or any other in the future) for ODIS-E (xml) and eventually understand it. As of now it is possible to load XML file and compare it with other XML file to see which parts are modified. 

Keywords: dataset, parametrization, ODIS-E, xml
